# Intelligent Log Searching and Threat Detection using AI
This project develops an intelligent security system integrating AI, Suricata, and the ELK Stack to enhance real-time threat detection, automate log analysis, and streamline incident response using AI-based searching and classification.

## Key Features
- **AI-Driven Log Analysis**: Utilizes machine learning to parse and analyze logs for rapid anomaly detection.
- **Real-Time Threat Detection**: Identifies potential security threats, such as intrusions and malicious activities, in real-time.
- **Automated Threat Response**: Generates dynamic rules and alerts for proactive threat mitigation.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Supports integration with diverse log sources and scales for large datasets.
- **Custom Dashboards**: Provides visualizations for monitoring and analyzing security events.
